    <h2>Sedai Capabilities</h2>
    <h3>Intelligent-Tiering Selection</h3>
    <p>AWS Intelligent-Tiering can provide cost and performance advantages but it's not always clear when the premium needed is cost justified.
    Sedai autonomously optimizes your S3 buckets by switching objects to the Intelligent-Tiering storage class at the bucket level and for groups of files within the bucket.
    This class automatically shifts objects between Standard and Archive tiers based on access patterns, ensuring cost-efficiency without compromising availability.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Problem solved:</span> Cost, Availability</p>
    <h3>Archive Access Transition</h3>
    <p>After migrating your buckets to the Intelligent-Tiering storage class, Sedai generates recommendations for transitioning rarely accessed buckets to Archive Access and Deep Archive Access tiers, realizing cost savings from these lower-cost tiers.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Problem solved:</span> Cost, Performance</p>
    <h3>Automated Remediation</h3>
    <p>Detects & remediates S3 problems with custom actions.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The complexity of managing Kubernetes applications at scale has surpassed the ability of teams using manual optimization, resulting in sub-optimal results and coping strategies such as over-provisioning of resources. Autonomous systems such as Sedai use machine learning to continually optimize performance, cost, and availability. Sedai autonomously detects, recommends, validates, and executes improvements in production without human intervention, at both an application and infrastructure level, extending native Kubernetes capabilities. Sedai uses rigorous safety checks to safely operate in production.</p>
        <p>Autonomous operation reduces low-value tasks (toil) by SREs & Operations teams, enabling them to accelerate delivery of higher-level initiatives. Sedai also accelerates innovation velocity by providing immediate feedback on new releases to development teams. Sedai offers an attractive ROI (700% for recent customers) and a rapid payback (<3 months) supported by a rapid rollout period (10 minutes for initial setup, and a ~2-week learning period).</p>

        <h1>The Challenge of Kubernetes Optimization</h1>
        <p>Using Kubernetes with microservice architectures offers major advantages over traditional architectures and has become a strategic imperative. However, Kubernetes is difficult to optimize. Many Kubernetes users experience unexpected cost growth, performance, and reliability problems. A key underlying challenge is the complexity of resource management. Users must specify a wide range of parameters (e.g., CPU, Memory) and other resources across large numbers of interrelated services in a dynamic environment that changes constantly as developers ship new code and user demand changes daily. Setting these parameters manually or using point-in-time optimization approaches fails to achieve optimal results on an ongoing basis and underdeliver on the potential of Kubernetes. Given these difficulties, many development teams opt for a coping strategy involving significant over-provisioning of resources to minimize performance issues.</p>
        <h1>The Sedai Approach</h1>
        <p>Sedai manages Kubernetes applications autonomously using state-of-the-art machine learning and predictive engines that detect potential optimization opportunities and issues within your application and take autonomous action to address them in production, optimizing cloud costs, improving performance, and ensuring availability. To enable this model, Sedai automatically discovers your application’s architecture, analyzes traffic patterns as well as performance and cost metrics. Sedai works with Kubernetes running on AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and any Kubernetes distribution via the Kubernetes API.</p>
        <h2>Autonomous</h2>
        <p>Sedai’s autonomous approach does not require manual thresholds or human intervention, unless desired by the user. This represents a substantial change to traditional tools (see below) – rather than just detecting and/or recommending changes, Sedai is able to validate changes to determine they are safe to make in production, as well as execute them in a production environment.</p>

        <h1>Page 8</h1>
        <h2>Application Aware</h2>
        <p>Unlike infrastructure-centric tools, Sedai understands the Kubernetes applications running and the dependencies between them through analysis of application behavior and high-level objectives set by the user. This enables Sedai to optimize separately for latency-sensitive applications that drive customer experience & revenue, and those that are cost-sensitive (e.g., batch workloads). After finding improvements that benefit both cost and latency, Sedai can prioritize cost alone, latency, or make a balanced tradeoff.</p>
        <h2>Continuous Learning</h2>
        <p>Sedai also evaluates the outcome to improve its ability to find future improvements, creating a continuous learning loop and providing more capabilities than one-time optimization tools. Sedai uses a reinforcement learning approach, providing its ML algorithms with reward signals as improvements are made in performance, cost, and availability, and as accurate predictions of application seasonality and application behavior are made.</p>
        <h2>Key Use Cases</h2>
        <h3>Reduce Cloud Costs</h3>
        <p>Sedai employs three sets of tactics to reduce Kubernetes costs: Application Optimization, Cluster Optimization, and Purchase Optimization; each approach can generate 20–30% cost savings.</p>
        <h4>1) Application Optimization:</h4>
        <p>Kubernetes services often run with low resource utilization which drives up cloud costs. The median Kubernetes deployment uses just 20–30% of requested CPU and 30–40% of requested memory. Sedai continuously learns from traffic patterns (e.g., Monday morning peak, night-time traffic lows) and uses this to match demand with resources needed. Where demand varies from predicted seasonality, Sedai will scale up or down. Sedai uses both horizontal and vertical scaling at the same time; most users today are not able to use horizontal and vertical together due to system limitations or without significant testing work. Sedai does this autonomously, allowing 24/7 operation and avoiding human error.</p>
        <p>An autonomous approach avoids the heavy manual workload of a threshold approach which requires extensive analysis and the correct thresholds often change with each new release. Sedai’s autonomous approach to cost management can resolve a common challenge for Kubernetes teams in which initial configurations may be set by development teams who have application reliability and performance as overriding concerns and are less focused on cost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-section">
        <h1>Page 9</h1>
        <p>Other settings may not be used at all e.g., only 40% of organizations use Kubernetes HPA (horizontal pod autoscaling) and less than 1% use VPA (vertical pod autoscaling). Sedai acts as a controller for HPA and VPA and can choose smartly between both, wherever it's available. Where HPA and VPA are not available, Sedai provides an autoscaling capability.</p>
        <p>The example at right shows a Sedai application optimization updating CPU and memory settings as well as reducing node count, improving resource usage on behalf of the SRE team.</p>
        <h3>2) Cluster Optimization:</h3>
        <p>Sedai optimizes the type and grouping of nodes to run applications. Sedai picks the optimal instances type to run applications (e.g., AWS M5 vs M6a). Sedai’s node group optimization allows applications with similar needs to run on the optimal instance type (e.g., memory-intensive vs compute-intensive). Unlike many other cloud cost tools, Sedai is application-aware and also uses the underlying application latency sensitivity to determine the optimal cluster configuration.</p>
        <h3>3) Purchase Optimization:</h3>
        <p>Sedai optimizes the cost of compute resources based on the instance purchasing options provided by public cloud providers including spot and reserved instances.</p>
        <h2>Improve Performance & Customer Experience through Reduced Latency</h2>
        <p>For customer-facing applications, latency is a top concern, driving customer experience and revenue. Sedai reduces latency by up to 95% at service level by finding the optimal parameters for memory and CPU, and placing the application in the optimal node group. In the example below, the execution time of a service that adds a new item to an ecommerce shopping cart was reduced by 88%:</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="ecommerce_optimization_graphic.png" alt="Ecommerce Optimization Example">
            <p><span class="bold">Duration Improved:</span> 88%<br><span class="bold">Total Duration Reduced:</span> 15 hours, 12 minutes</p>
        </div>
        <p>Sedai also reports on the number of days of cumulative latency reduction achieved and the cloud spend needed (where applicable) to achieve this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-section">
        <h1>Page 10</h1>
        <h2>Improve Availability</h2>
        <p>While application uptime has improved across the industry in recent years, outages remain a key risk with potential revenue and reputation impacts as well as absorbing significant team resources during the event. Sedai improves availability through scaling patterns based on seasonality to respond to demand surges. Sedai also watches to see if services are experiencing common problems such as high CPU usage resulting in throttling, or out of memory errors.</p>
        <p>Sedai uses an escalation-based remediation approach. Depending on the observed application context, Sedai attempts multiple remediations based on the learning from past application behavior. For example, Sedai may first try to restart the service and if that does not address the issue Sedai may recommend changing the CPU or Memory limits (and execute those in autonomous mode after applying safety checks). The example shown at right shows the detection and proposed remediation of a memory issue.</p>
        <h2>Hit SLOs</h2>
        <p>Sedai supports organizations with existing SLOs and can also automatically (or manually) set SLOs for organizations not yet using SLOs. Where SLOs are not yet in place, Sedai can auto-recommend SLOs based on analysis of application behavior and user-provided tags (e.g., key checkout services for ecommerce). These SLOs are then autonomously managed by Sedai, which ensures that performance for each service falls within the SLO. For example, if a service slows down (below the latency SLO) during a peak traffic period, Sedai will scale it up to compensate and make sure it stays within the SLO.</p>

        <h2>Improve SRE Productivity by Reducing Toil</h2>
        <p>Sedai enables you to support workload growth without needing to linearly scale up the SRE team. Sedai’s autonomous detection and optimization mean the work of detecting & resolving issues and manually finding optimization can now be managed by SREs with significant lower effort as the autonomous system takes care of many tasks on their behalf. For example, it is tedious for teams to configure HPA/VPA when they have multiple applications and each needs different thresholds. Sedai enables SREs to be less concerned with what is happening in the infrastructure and the chaos of alert fatigue and reactive troubleshooting, and instead focus on new deployments, site enhancements, and other priorities. SREs use Sedai to check new applications and services are on-boarding effectively, that autonomous mode is on, and reviewing optimizations executed by Sedai.</p>
        <h2>Release with Confidence</h2>
        <p>Sedai provides early feedback on the performance of every Kubernetes service release with Release intelligence. Sedai will autonomously detect new releases entering production. Sedai analyzes the release compared to the prior release on latency and error count using models that take into account seasonality and traffic patterns under load. Each release is rated on a scale of 1–10 based on the amount of deviation from the prior release (example below).</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p><span class="bold">Moderate Deviations:</span> 7.5</p>
            <p>Analyzed from Monday, Dec. 6, 11:58 PM to Wednesday, Dec. 8, 8:10 AM</p>
            <p>Some changes detected in resource metrics. We recommend reviewing release to avoid potential issues.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can receive recommendations on whether to rollback a release if it doesn’t meet certain criteria or parameters. In addition, scores provide signals to developers on where effort should be placed to optimize the underlying application code. You can either integrate with your CI/CD process to provide the optimal configuration established from prior releases, or when you redeploy Sedai can set your Kubernetes configuration to this optimal level.</p>
        <h2>Accelerate Innovation Velocity</h2>
        <p>Sedai users accelerate the speed at which their organizations operate the DevOps cycle. In Development stages, autonomous setting of Kubernetes configurations reduces the burden on Developers and frees them up to focus on core functionality. Release Intelligence supports both the Dev (feedback) and Ops part of the loop (faster releases). Autonomous operations reduce the time taken to perform actions in the Ops part of the cycle.</p>

        <h2>The Challenge of Serverless Optimization</h2>
        <p>In dynamic production environments, it has become virtually impossible for companies to continuously optimize serverless functions and overall application performance. The result is either application performance and latency challenges (and potentially lost revenue) or wasted cloud spend.</p>
        <p>Even if a point-in-time optimization is made, it can become outdated quickly due to constantly changing & unpredictable traffic loads and changes in the serverless function code base with every new release.</p>
        <p>The task becomes unmanageable especially when teams run 100s or 1000s of serverless functions. SRE teams also must spread their bandwidth across multiple priorities.</p>
        <p>To optimize serverless functions, teams must continuously:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rightsize function memory</li>
            <li>Manage provisioned concurrency</li>
            <li>Choose how and when to warm up serverless functions and how to keep them warm</li>
            <li>Trace errors in this heavily distributed environment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Autonomous Approach</h2>
        <p>Sedai manages serverless functions autonomously using state-of-the-art machine learning and predictive engines that detect potential optimization opportunities and issues within your serverless functions and take autonomous action to address them in production, improving performance, ensuring availability, and optimizing cloud costs. Acting as an intelligent autopilot for SREs, Sedai eliminates significant toil for SREs so they can increase time spent on innovation. Sedai intelligently discovers AWS Lambda functions, analyzes traffic patterns and metric performance and then continuously manages your production environments — without manual thresholds or human intervention.</p>
        <h2>Autonomous Optimization</h2>
        <h3>Improve Customer Experience through Reduced Latency</h3>
        <p>For most SRE teams, the number one serverless concern is latency. Latency drives customer experience and revenue. Sedai reduces latency by up to 95% at a function level by finding the optimal parameters or the function by optimizing memory settings (and indirectly CPU), concurrency (provisioned and reserved), and timeouts for Lambda functions. In the example below, the execution time of a function that adds an item to an ecommerce shopping cart has been reduced by 88%:</p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p><span class="bold">Duration Improved:</span> 88%<br><span class="bold">Total Duration Reduced:</span> 15 hours, 12 minutes</p>
            <p>Prod01-commerceApi-cart-cart-item-add</p>
        </div>
        <p>Sedai also reports on the number of days of cumulative latency reduction achieved and the cloud spend needed (where applicable) to achieve this.</p>
        <h3>Reduce Cloud Costs</h3>
        <p>Sedai improves your serverless costs through autonomous optimizations. When lambda functions are not extensively used (e.g., during night time traffic lows), Sedai scales down memory based on the traffic pattern. In addition to memory, Sedai also cost-optimizes provisioned concurrency to avoid over-provisioning and optimize function warm up. After finding improvements that benefit both cost and latency, Sedai gives you the option to then prioritize cost alone, latency, or make a balanced tradeoff.</p>

        <h1>Integrating Karpenter</h1>
        <p>Achieve autonomous Kubernetes management that leverages Karpenter's unique real-time node selection.</p>
        <h2>Karpenter Overview</h2>
        <p>Karpenter is an open-source node provisioning project built for Kubernetes, sponsored by AWS. Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by provisioning nodes that meet the requirements of the pods (e.g., CPU, GPUs, and memory) that the Kubernetes scheduler has marked as unschedulable.</p>
        <p>Karpenter removes the requirement to specify node type (e.g., m5.large) & node groups, although users can provide criteria to choose specific instances (e.g., use spot for certain workloads). It is the most common alternative to the default Kubernetes autoscaler for AWS users. See below for an overview of how Karpenter works:</p>
        <h2>How Karpenter Complements Sedai</h2>
        <p>Sedai runs your applications at its best performance, cost, and availability. Sedai continuously monitors and learns your application to make informed decisions based on application infrastructure efficiency. Sedai builds a clear understanding of your application, its stateful or stateless nature, CPU & memory intensity, and response to horizontal or vertical scaling and the ideal and anomalous behavior of each of its dependencies.</p>
        <p>While Karpenter supports your Kubernetes Cluster Scheduler, Sedai focuses on cost, performance, and availability from a holistic application & infrastructure perspective.</p>
        <h3>Combined Use Cases</h3>
        <p>The combination of Karpenter and Sedai can provide superior overall performance, availability, and cost. Karpenter's real-time scaling of nodes (adding and picking node types) is a unique function not performed by the Sedai platform. Karpenter’s real-time scaling can be made more powerful by leveraging Sedai’s granular understanding of application needs and traffic prediction capability. Three primary use cases for Karpenter with Sedai are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">Optimizing node types:</span> Uses Sedai’s understanding of application and workload/application-level data to allow predictive scaling.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Predictive scaling:</span> Sedai’s predictive scaling is performed at the workload/application level and allows Sedai to predict the need for additional pods in advance, reducing the risk of performance deterioration during periods of rising traffic.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Optimizing spot vs. on-demand purchasing decisions:</span> Sedai recommends the optimal balance between spot and on-demand instances, reducing costs while maintaining reliability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Integration Approach</h2>
        <p>Initial setup of Sedai with Karpenter could be achieved by installing Karpenter through Sedai’s agent when the agent is connected to an AWS account with an additional installation step. Alternatively, Karpenter can be added later.</p>
        <p>Karpenter’s compute provisioning for Kubernetes clusters is configured by a custom resource called <span class="bold">Provisioner</span>. Ongoing joint operation of Karpenter with Sedai would be achieved by Sedai sending configuration changes to Provisioner.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous cost optimization:</strong> Unlike static automation rules, AI continually learns and finds more savings using Reinforcement Learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety & Application awareness:</strong> AI is aware of customer experience needs (via performance and availability metrics & SLOs) and factors these into safe optimization choices.</li>
            <li><strong>Copilot and Autopilot modes:</strong> Autonomous execution means Engineering does not need to spend time on every change, reducing engineering effort (aka toil).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why teams are embracing the Results Era</h2>
        <h3>It’s time to leave behind the challenges of the Recommendations Era</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Backlog of recommendations:</strong> Slow execution & stale cost savings recommendations due to reliance on scarce engineering bandwidth.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulties staying optimized:</strong> New releases mean recommendations need to be revisited as pre-AI systems operate on static rules and aren’t capable of learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Uncertain end user impacts:</strong> Current recommendation tools don’t fully consider performance and availability, creating safety risks & leading to delayed implementation.</li>
